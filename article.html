                    <div class="article-ptext-main">
                        <p>Interaction design, often abbreviated as IxD, is "the practice of designing interactive
                            digital
                            products, environments, systems, and services." While interaction design has an interest in
                            form
                            (similar to other design fields), its main area of focus rests on behavior. Rather than
                            analyzing
                            how things are, interaction design synthesizes and imagines things as they could be. This
                            element of
                            interaction design is what characterizes IxD as a design field, as opposed to a science or
                            engineering field.</p>

                        <p>Interaction design borrows from a wide range of fields like psychology, human-computer
                            interaction,
                            information architecture, and user research to create designs that are tailored to the needs
                            and
                            preferences of users. This involves understanding the context in which the product will be
                            used,
                            identifying user goals and behaviors, and developing design solutions that are responsive to
                            user
                            needs and expectations.</p>

                        <p>While disciplines such as software engineering have a heavy focus on designing for technical
                            stakeholders, interaction design is focused on meeting the needs and optimizing the
                            experience of
                            users, within relevant technical or business constraints.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Methodologies</h2>

                <h3>Goal-oriented design</h3>
                <p>Goal-oriented design (or Goal-Directed design) "is concerned with satisfying the needs and desires of
                    the users of a product or service.</p>

                <p>Alan Cooper argues in The Inmates Are Running the Asylum that we need a new approach to solving
                    interactive software-based problems. The problems with designing computer interfaces are
                    fundamentally different from those that do not include software (e.g., hammers). Cooper introduces
                    the concept of cognitive friction, which is when the interface of a design is complex and difficult
                    to use, and behaves inconsistently and unexpectedly, possessing different modes.</p>

                <p>Alternatively, interfaces can be designed to serve the needs of the service/product provider. User
                    needs may be poorly served by this approach.</p>

                <h3>Usability</h3>
                <div>
                    <div class="article-ptext-main">
                        <p>Usability answers the question "can someone use this interface?". Jakob Nielsen describes
                            usability
                            as the quality attribute that describes how usable the interface is. Shneiderman proposes
                            principles
                            for designing more usable interfaces called "Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design"â€”which
                            are
                            well-known heuristics for creating usable systems.</p>

                <h3>Personas</h3>
                <p>Personas are archetypes that describe the various goals and observed behaviour patterns among users.
                    A persona encapsulates critical behavioural data in a way that both designers and stakeholders can
                    understand, remember, and relate to. Personas use storytelling to engage users' social and emotional
                    aspects, which helps designers to either visualize the best product behaviour or see why the
                    recommended design is successful.</p>

                <h3>Cognitive dimensions</h3>
                <p>The cognitive dimensions framework provides a vocabulary to evaluate and modify design solutions.
                    Cognitive dimensions offer a lightweight approach to analysis of a design quality, rather than an
                    in-depth, detailed description. They provide a common vocabulary for discussing notation, user
                    interface or programming language design.</p>

                <p>Dimensions provide high-level descriptions of the interface and how the user interacts with it:
                    examples include consistency, error-proneness, hard mental operations, viscosity and premature
                    commitment. These concepts aid the creation of new designs from existing ones through design
                    maneuvers that alter the design within a particular dimension.</p>

                <h3>Affective interaction design</h3>
                <p>Designers must be aware of elements that influence user emotional responses. For instance, products
                    must convey positive emotions while avoiding negative ones. Other important aspects include
                    motivational, learning, creative, social and persuasive influences. One method that can help convey
                    such aspects is for example, the use of dynamic icons, animations and sound to help communicate,
                    creating a sense of interactivity. Interface aspects such as fonts, color palettes and graphical
                    layouts can influence acceptance. Studies showed that affective aspects can affect perceptions of
                    usability.</p>

                <p>Emotion and pleasure theories exist to explain interface responses. These include Don Norman's
                    emotional design model, Patrick Jordan's pleasure model and McCarthy and Wright's Technology as
                    Experience framework.</p>
