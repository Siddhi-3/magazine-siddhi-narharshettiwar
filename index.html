            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>User experience design (UX design, UXD, UED, or XD), upon which is the centralized requirements for "User
                Experience Design Research" (also known as UX Design Research), defines the experience a user would go
                through when interacting with a company, its services, and its products. User experience design is a
                user centered design approach because it considers the user's experience when using a product or
                platform. Research, data analysis, and test results drive design decisions in UX design rather than
                aesthetic preferences and opinions, for which is known as UX Design Research.</p>

                        <p>User experience design is a conceptual design discipline rooted in human factors and
                            ergonomics. This field, since the
                            late 1940s, has focused on the interaction between human users, machines, and contextual
                            environments to design systems
                            that address the user's experience. User experience became a positive insight for
                            designers in the early 1990s with
                            the proliferation of workplace computers. Don Norman, a professor and researcher in design,
                            usability, and cognitive
                            science, coined the term "user experience", and brought it to a wider audience that is
                            inside our modernized society.</p>

                <div class="history-quoteDN">
                    <p>I invented the term because I thought human interface and usability were too narrow. I wanted to
                        cover all aspects of the person's experience with the system including industrial design
                        graphics, the interface, the physical interaction and the manual. Since then the term has spread
                        widely, so much so that it is starting to lose its meaning.</p>

                    <p>Usability testing is the most common method designers use to test their designs. The basic idea
                        behind conducting a usability test is to check whether the design of a product meets user
                        requirements.</p>
                    <p>While designers conduct tests they are not testing for the design; rather every
                        design is a hypothesis, and they are trying to find evidence for or against the hypothesis as a
                        way to
                        improve software development UX. Designers only do usability testing in one, and often as the
                        last step in the design process.</p>
                    <p>Usability also plays an important role in the delivery of an interface that produces a positive
                        user experience. A variety of factors influence the testing process. Employing qualitative and
                        quantitative methods provides an objective process, which can be used to make changes to refine
                        and improve user feedback during user usability testing.</p>
